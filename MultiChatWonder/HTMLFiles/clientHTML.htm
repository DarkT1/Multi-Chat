        <p id="Title" style="font-size:35px;text-decoration:underline; text-align:center;font-weight:bold;background-color:aquamarine">Help With Client</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please note that a client can only connect to a server on the same LAN due to firewalls, port connections, and other issues. Thus, a connection over the internet will <strong>NOT</strong> be implemented. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For security reasons, the program will not display a list of running servers to choose from. Thus, the IP Address and Port Number of the Server <strong>MUST</strong> be known.  If you are entrusted with the Server's IP Address and Port number, please do <strong style="color:red">NOT</strong> give it to another person unless given permission by the Server's Owner to do so.  </p>
        <br>
        
        <p>To create a client, begin by clicking "Join" as you will be joining a server. Fill in the textfields dedicated to a "Username", "Port", and "Server Address". Then, click "Join" once again. The program will check your input for validity. If an error with validity or any error in general occurs (i.e. Server Kicking, Invalid Input, etc.), then an error screen will appear. The error screen will prompt you to "Restart or Exit" the program. If all goes well and a connection is established, you will have successfully connected a client to the server.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        As a client, it is your responsibility to abide by the rules established by the server's owner. To send a message, use the dedicated textfield and the send button/"Enter" key. Unlike the server-side of the program, the client-side will not display all the usernames of the clients connected to the server due to security reasons.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>Spam, Malicious Behavior, or anything of the sort will likely result in the kicking/closing of your connection to the server as the server admin does have the power to kick a client. Also, a computer can run more than one client/server; however, your computer will experience lag and a lower performance rate in doing so. </p>
        
        
        <br>
        <p><strong style="color:red">CAUTION: With the knowledge of an IP address and the ID of an open port, an unauthorized person can exploit your connection with the server. In addition, using the app for wrong-doing/illegal activities will result in your priveleges being revoked. If you attempt to impersonate someone, i.e using their common username the program will simply add a number to the end of your username to differentiate between the two of you.</strong> </p>
