        <br>
        <p>Please note that a client can only connect to a server on the same LAN due to firewalls, port connections, and other issues. Thus, a connection over the internet will <strong>NOT</strong> be implemented.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>To initiate a server, being by clicking "host" as you will be hosting a server. Fill in the dedicated fields for "Username" and "Port". The server address field has been pre-filled for you as the server will always be localhosted. Then, click "Launch". The program will check if the port is open and valid. If your input passes this test, you will have successfully created a server on your computer.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong> The server will continue running as long as the application is not closed out. However, if an error occurs the program will direct you to an error page that will prompt you to either "Exit" or "Restart" the program. Also note, that you will not be able to send any messages until there is at least 1 client connected to your server. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>The Kick Feature: </strong> As the server's admin/creator, you have the privelege to kick other users. To do so, simply click the user's username in the list. That user's username will appear in the textfield. Then, click the "Kick" button.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong style="font-size:20px;" id="Features">Cool Features: </strong></p>
        <ul>
        
            <li><strong>Hold Shift+Select Two Users in the List</strong> - This will allow you to select a group of all consecutive users between those two selected users (This makes it easier to kick more than one person at once).</li>
            <li><strong>Hold Ctrl+Select Individual Users </strong> - This will allow you to select a group of users that are not consecutive to one another (This makes it easier to kick more than one person at once). Note, using this shortcut on a selected user will deselect them. </li>
            <li><strong>Enter</strong> - When the message field has focus, hitting "Enter" will allow you to quickly send messages without the hassle of clicking the send button.</li>
            <li><strong>The List of Users</strong> - It will auto-update based on who leaves/connects to your server.</li>
            <li><strong>The Kick TextField</strong> - This will display all the users that are selected to be kicked. (It will clear after clicking the "kick" button). In addition, the textfield will update based on selection and/or deselection.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <br>
         <p><strong style="color:red">CAUTION: With the knowledge of an IP address and the ID of an open port, an unauthorized person can exploit your connection with the server. SO DO <strong style = "color:blue;">NOT</strong> give out your IP Address and Port Number openly. In addition, using the app for wrong-doing/illegal activities will result in your priveleges being revoked. If you attempt to impersonate someone, i.e using their common username the program will simply add a number to the end of your username to differentiate between the two of you.</strong> </p>
